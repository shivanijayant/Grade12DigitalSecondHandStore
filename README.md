Project Aim:
To make a digital store, for customers to be able to directly exchange secondhand items that would normally be thrown away in perfect condition but can now be reused by someone else. 

Description:
	•	Each user will have to create an account, which would store details about their activities on the site.
	•	The project would consist of a screen to view items put on sale by other users. One can click on the item they are interested in to view more details about it, like size, material, condition, etc. They can then directly get in touch with the sellers via the contact details provided on the site, if they are interested in purchasing the article. Alternatively, they can add the articles to their digital cart, to be considered later. 
	•	Users will also have the option of posting their own items for sale, and will have to type out a description, and fill out details required by potential customers when doing so.
	•	 A database will be used to store information about the users’ IDs, the items uploaded, and those in their carts. Files will also be employed to display categories.
